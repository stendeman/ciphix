This project has the following endpoints:

"/" user text input for sentiment analysis, showing the resulting sentiment scores

"/history" a table with the complete history of user posts


Problem Statement:

Imagine a scenario where a company wants to analyze the sentiment of customer
reviews for their products or services. They have collected a large dataset of text
reviews and want to build an API that provides sentiment analysis for these reviews
using the "asent" model from spaCy. The company also uses Django Rest Framework
for their backend.
